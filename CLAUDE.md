# CLAUDE.md — footystats-proxy

## Project Overview

A Node.js/Express proxy server that predicts first-half (FH) goals in football matches. It fetches data from the football-data-api.com API, applies a 3-signal pre-game ranking algorithm, and serves predictions via a server-rendered HTML frontend with async JSON loading.

**Live:** https://footystats-proxy.onrender.com | **Hosted on:** Render.com

## Architecture

**Single-file monolith:** All application logic lives in `server.js` (~870 lines). No build step, no transpilation, no framework — vanilla JS throughout.

```
server.js          — Express server, API proxy, prediction engine, HTML frontend
package.json       — Dependencies and start script
.github/workflows/ — Keep-alive cron ping (every 20 min)
```

### Key Subsystems in server.js

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **safeFetch / rate limiting** | Wraps API calls with timeout, caching, and rate-limit detection |
| **In-memory caches** | `FIXTURE_CACHE`, `LEAGUE_MATCHES_CACHE`, `TEAM_STATS_CACHE`, `SERVER_MATCH_CACHE` with TTLs |
| **Prediction engine** | `buildLast5()` → `last5Form()` → `computeSignals()` pipeline; 3 signals — A + B (last-5 FH form) and C (season mismatch gap). `extractStats()` builds the season-stat `snap` frozen pre-game. |
| **buildHTML()** | Server-side HTML/CSS/JS generation (inline, no templates) |
| **Routes** | `/` (HTML shell), `/preds` (JSON API), `/cache-status`, `/debug`, `/api/*` (passthrough) |

### Data Flow

```
Client loads / → HTML shell renders instantly
  → Client JS fetches /preds?tz=<offset>
    → Server fetches fixtures for 5-day range
    → For each league/season: fetch matches + team stats (cached)
    → extractStats() per team → computeSignals() per match
    → JSON response → Client renders predictions
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (no specific version pinned)
- `FOOTY_API_KEY` environment variable (required — app exits without it)
- `PORT` environment variable (optional, defaults to 3001)

### Commands

```bash
npm install        # Install dependencies
npm start          # Run server (node server.js)
```

There is no test suite, linter, or build step configured.

### Dependencies

- `express` — Web framework
- `cors` — CORS middleware
- `dotenv` — Environment variable loading
- `node-fetch@2` — HTTP client (CommonJS-compatible v2)

## Prediction Algorithm (3-Signal Ranking)

Rank is **derived from the calibrated probability**, not from counting signals, so rank
and probability always move together (a higher rank is always a higher-probability match).
It is tiered on `prob15` (FH-over-1.5, the primary bet): `>=45 → 3`, `>=40 → 2`, `>=30 → 1`,
else `0`. 🔥 Fire (2–3) → 📢 Signal (1) → Low (0). `eligible` = rank ≥ 2. This replaced the
old "rank = signals fired" count, which could disagree with probability because Signal C is
anti-additive with B (a high signal-count combo like `011` carries a *low* probability).
The match list sorts by rank, which — because rank is a probability tier — is probability order.

### Signals

A and B are **last-5 FH form** signals (read from `snap.l5`, pre-kickoff). C is a
**season-stat mismatch** signal (read from `snap.home`/`snap.away`, frozen pre-game).

| Signal | Name | Rule | Data source |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| A | Mutual Instability | `snap.l5.home.t >= 1.6` AND `snap.l5.away.t >= 1.4` | Last-5 FH form (pre-kickoff) |
| B | Away Team Scoring | `snap.l5.away.f >= 0.8` | Last-5 FH form (pre-kickoff) |
| C | Team Mismatch | `\|(home.scored_fh − home.conced_fh) − (away.scored_fh − away.conced_fh)\| >= 0.5` | Season stats (frozen pre-game) |

`snap.l5.home.t` / `snap.l5.away.t` are each team's last-5 FH **total** (scored + conceded
per game); `snap.l5.away.f` is the away team's last-5 FH **scored** average.

**A and B require `snap.l5`** (both teams had ≥ 3 recent games — `last5Form()` returns null
otherwise). **C does NOT require `snap.l5`** — it reads season stats, so it can fire on
thin-coverage leagues where `l5` is null (its one cross-over benefit for the blind spot).

`computeSignals(snap, hLast5, aLast5)` returns:
- `rank` = signals fired (0–3), `label` = Low / Signal / Fire
- `prob15`, `prob25` = global combo-table probabilities (see below)
- `ci` = combined intensity (`homeL5Total + awayL5Total`) — used for display/sorting
- `defCi` = away last-5 FH total (`awayL5Total`)
- `eligible` = rank ≥ 2
- `ov15Candidate` / `ov25Candidate` = FH over-1.5 / over-2.5 **candidate** flags (see below);
  also `envFh` (= both teams' season `scored_fh + conced_fh`) and `l5Fh` (= home+away
  last-5 FH scored) — the two combined inputs they use
- `signals` = `{ A: {…}, B: {…}, C: {…}, O15: {…}, O25: {…} }`

### Over-1.5 / Over-2.5 FH candidate signals

Separate from the A/B/C combo, two **candidate** flags detect FH over-goal targets via three
pre-game checks that must all clear (rounded to absorb float drift at the boundary):

| Flag | env_fh (`Σ scored_fh+conced_fh`) | l5_fh (`Σ last-5 FH scored`) | model prob |
|------|------|------|------|
| `ov25Candidate` (Over 2.5 FH) | ≥ 2.85 | ≥ 1.6 | `prob25` ≥ 14.5 |
| `ov15Candidate` (Over 1.5 FH) | ≥ 2.60 | ≥ 1.4 | `prob15` ≥ 38 |

They surface as `signals.O15` / `signals.O25` and as **O1.5 / O2.5 badges** on the match card
(`candidatePill()`). They fire **no betPill** and don't affect rank/sort — detection only. The
identical logic runs offline in `scripts/ov25_score.py` over a dataset export. They rely on
season FH stats (always present) + `l5` (null on thin leagues → `l5_fh = 0` → won't fire there).

### Probability Tables

Combo-keyed (`PROB15_BY_COMBO` / `PROB25_BY_COMBO` in `server.js`, key = bit(A)+bit(B)+bit(C)),
recalibrated on the **clean live cohort (n=869, women excluded)** via `/signalc-validate`:

| Combo (A B C) | n | prob15 (FH>1.5) | prob25 (FH>2.5) |
|-------|---|-----------------|-----------------|
| 110 — A+B, no mismatch | 46 | **50.0%** | 19.6% |
| 010 — B only | 172 | 43.6% | 14.5% |
| 001 — mismatch only (rank-0 rescue) | 211 | 39.3% | **12.3%** |
| 011 — B + mismatch | 112 | 39.3% | 5.4% (C hurts B) |
| 111 — all three | 40 | 37.5% | 20.0% |
| 101 — A + mismatch | 25 | 36.0% | 20.0% |
| 100 — A only | 9* | 35.3% | 14.7% |
| 000 — neither | 254 | 26.0% | 6.7% |

\* combo 100 borrows the stabler A-only 2-combo value (raw n=9 was unreliable).

Key findings:
- **C (team mismatch) only adds value where A+B are silent.** In combo `00` (rank-0) it
  lifts FH>2.5 from 6.7% → 12.3% and FH>1.5 from 26% → 39.3% (n=211 vs 254). This held
  out-of-sample (`/mismatch-holdout`, `/rank0-holdout`): train→test lift was stable/positive.
- **C is anti-additive with B**: among B-only games a big mismatch *lowers* FH>2.5 to 5.4%
  (one-sided games stay one-sided). The combo table encodes this — never read C as +1 quality.
- **A+B (110) remains the strongest FH>2.5/FH>1.5 combo.** A alone is still worthless.
- betPill is signal-based: 🔥 when A+B fire, 🎯 when B fires. **C fires no bet pill** — it
  reshapes probabilities/ranking only.

Recalibrate via `/signalc-validate` (full 8-combo table + holdout stability + C's marginal
lift within each A+B combo). Re-run when the cohort roughly doubles.

### combo string format

`comboFromSignals()` returns a **3-char string**: bit(A) + bit(B) + bit(C).
e.g. "111" = all three, "001" = mismatch only, "010" = B only, "000" = neither.
`applyLeagueProb()` uses this 3-char key. **NOTE:** the Supabase
`compute_league_combo_buckets()` RPC still emits the old **2-char** key (it predates C),
so 3-char league-combo lookups miss and gracefully fall back to the global recalibrated
8-combo table. (The coarse per-league *rank* override was removed — see PR #60 — so the
fallback chain is now simply league-combo → global.) Per-league combo overrides stay
dormant until that RPC is updated to bit(A)+bit(B)+bit(C); the global table covers all
combos meanwhile.

### Clean data — what to trust

The Supabase `match_results` table has three source types:

| fetchedAt | Rows | Usable for signal analysis? |
|-----------|------|----------------------------|
| `historical-import` | ~18k | ❌ Season stats are end-of-season (look-ahead bias) |
| `backfill` | ~11k | ❌ Same — season stats fetched after the fact |
| Timestamp (e.g. `2026-05-03 00:11`) | ~800+ | ✅ Snap frozen pre-game, clean |

**Always filter to live rows** for any backtesting or recalibration:
```sql
WHERE snap->>'fetchedAt' NOT IN ('historical-import', 'backfill')
  AND snap->>'fetchedAt' NOT LIKE '%(from history)%'
```

Clean rows grow by ~10–15/day. ~860 completed matches at last calibration.
Run `/signal-backtest` (or `/calibration`) for the authoritative current `cohortSize`.

### snap structure (live-captured rows)

```json
{
  "fetchedAt": "2026-05-03 00:11",
  "home": { "name": "...", "scored_fh": 0.94, "conced_fh": 0.61, "t1_pct": 27.0, "cn010_avg": 0.09, "sot_avg": 0 },
  "away": { "name": "...", "scored_fh": 0.55, "conced_fh": 0.70, "t1_pct": 13.0, "cn010_avg": 0.12, "sot_avg": 0 },
  "l5": { "home": { "f": 0.8, "a": 0.6, "t": 1.4 }, "away": { "f": 0.6, "a": 0.8, "t": 1.4 } },
  "prematch": { "o15HT": 42, "o05HT": 78, "xgHome": 0.61, "xgAway": 0.44, "btts_fhg": 31 }
}
```

`snap.l5` is **self-reconstructed only**: built from `LEAGUE_MATCHES_CACHE` game history,
present when both teams had ≥ 3 recent cached games. For thin/new seasons (USL2, WPSL on
short calendars) the cache is near-empty, so `snap.l5` stays null and **neither signal can
fire** — the known blind spot.

> **FootyStats does NOT expose last-5 HT team stats.** The team-stats endpoint
> (`/league-teams?include=stats`, ~1065 keys) carries only season-aggregate HT fields
> (`scoredAVGHT_overall/_home/_away`) — there is **no `scoredAVGHT_*_5` field**. A native
> last-5 fallback is therefore impossible; verified via `/debug-raw-api` (`verdict` block).
> The fallback path for thin leagues is `snap.prematch` (below), not team stats.

`snap.prematch` (optional): FootyStats' **own** pre-match first-half predictors, read from
the `/league-matches` endpoint and frozen at capture time. These ARE populated on every
match, including thin-coverage leagues where `l5` is null:
- `o15HT` / `o05HT` — FootyStats' FH-over-1.5 / over-0.5 potential scores (0–100).
- `xgHome` / `xgAway` — pre-match expected goals (full match).
- `btts_fhg` — both-teams-to-score-in-FH potential.

Not yet wired into the signals — captured and being calibrated (`/prematch-mine`) as a
candidate **fallback FH predictor when `snap.l5` is null**. Backfill onto historical rows
with `/admin/backfill-prematch` (these fields persist on completed matches, so they can be
read retroactively and correlated with the FH results we already hold).

> **Calibration status (2026-06, n≈689 with prematch):** `o15HT_potential` predicts FH>1.5
> cleanly and monotonically **on the full cohort** (≥50 → 48% vs 36.4% base, lift 1.32;
> ≥55 → 53.5%). **But it does NOT replicate on the `l5`-null blind-spot subset** (the only
> place it would actually be used): there, ≥50 gives 33% FH>1.5 at n=12 — *below* the
> subset's own 36.7% base. Pre-match `xg` is noise on both (full-match xG ≠ FH). `btts_fhg`
> looks strong on the subset (lift ~1.8) but at n=9. **Do NOT wire any prematch field as a
> live fallback** until the blind-spot subset (`/prematch-mine` → `blindspot`) reaches
> n≳100 and a cutoff holds clearly above that subset's own `baseRate15`. The full-cohort
> result is carried by established leagues and must not be trusted for thin leagues.

`snap.home/away` season stats are always present for live rows. Each carries an
optional **`xt`** sub-object (forward captures only, post-2026-06): extended FootyStats
season fields frozen pre-game — `o15ht`/`o05ht`/`bttsfhg`/`leadHT` (HT percentages),
`xgf`/`xga` (season xG per game), `datk` (dangerous attacks/game), `fhsc`/`fhcn` (FH goals
scored/conceded per game, 0–40'). These **cannot be backfilled** — team season stats are
cumulative, so re-fetching later leaks post-match games (the look-ahead trap). They only
populate going forward; `/season-mine` uses them with a train/test date split.

### Women's Leagues — Excluded from Signal Calibration

The following competition IDs are excluded from clean signal analysis:

| competition_id | League |
|---------------|--------|
| 15020 | Liga MX Femenil |
| 16037 | (women's) |
| 16046 | Arsenal Women / WSL |
| 16563 | Women's internationals |

These leagues **are served live** (predicted with the global table, like any league — the
PR #60 `computePreds` skip was reverted). They are excluded **only from recalibration /
model-fitting**, not from serving: the CSV loader, `/admin/backfill`, `/corner-mine`, and
the `exclude_women` calibration queries all drop them so the men's-calibrated thresholds
aren't biased by a different-distribution population.

**This exclusion is a precaution, not a validated result** — it was never backed by measured
women's base rates/lift. To validate (and decide whether they need their own table), run the
women's-only cohort: `/signal-backtest?women_only=true` and `/calibration?women_only=true`
(mirror of `exclude_women`). Women's leagues often have wider talent gaps → more mismatches,
so they're also a natural test case for **Signal C**. Until that cohort is checked, women's
matches are shown but their probabilities use the men's table.

### Look-ahead bias — lessons learned

- `historical-import` and `backfill` rows used season-aggregate stats fetched **after** the match,
  making all their signal features end-of-season figures. Any analysis on those rows is inflated.
- `ci` and `def_ci` in those rows were computed from old season-stat-based signals (not last-5 form)
  and are equally tainted.
- The current A and B signals read only from `snap.l5` (last-5 FH form), which is frozen
  pre-kickoff for live rows — look-ahead-free. They are NOT valid for backfill/historical-import
  rows (those rows often lack `snap.l5` or carry stale form).
- **Never recalibrate on tainted rows.** Always filter to live captures.

### Deprecated / removed signals

> Note: signal **letters were reused** across model generations. The current production
> signals are A = Mutual Instability and B = Away Team Scoring (both last-5 form).
> The rows below are *older, dropped* signals — do not confuse the dropped "B (Attack vs
> Leak)" with today's B.

| Signal (old) | Reason dropped |
|--------------|---------------|
| E — Home Profile (`t1_pct≥25 & scored_fh≥0.94`, season stats) | Replaced by last-5 form model (A+B); the A+E setup was the prior generation |
| Old B — Attack vs Leak (`hF>1.0 & aA>1.0`) | n=19 on clean data, too thin |
| Old C — Both Scoring (`hF>0.8 & aF>0.8`) | Below baseline on clean data (36.4% FH>1.5 vs 38.1% base) |
| Old D — Both Open (`hT>1.5 & aT>1.5`) | n=13 on clean data, too thin |
| Old season-stat signals (CI≥3.2, T1 both≥25%, etc.) | Look-ahead bias inflated results |
| Odds signals (O1, FH O2.5) | Not reliably available pre-kickoff |
| CN010 as core signal | Near-zero additive value on clean data |

## Caching

All caching is in-memory (no external cache store):

| Cache | TTL |
|-------|-----|
| Fixtures (by date) | 30 minutes |
| League matches (by season) | 2 hours |
| Team stats (by season) | 6 hours |

Rate limiting is detected from API response metadata and prevents further
requests until the reset time. Cached data is served while rate-limited.

## Data Capture

Pre-game snaps are frozen and completed results recorded by `persistEarlySnapshots()`
+ `persistCompletedPreds()`, which run on **every `/preds` call** AND on a
**traffic-independent timer** (`selfCapture()`, every 20 min — see `SELF_CAPTURE_TTL`).
The timer exists because `computePreds` only covers a 5-day forward window: a match
drops out the day after it completes, so without it a low-traffic day would leave the
result permanently unrecorded (a "pending" row: snap frozen, `hit_25 IS NULL`). The
keep-alive cron keeps the instance warm so the timer fires.

Rows that went pending before self-capture existed can be recovered with
`GET /admin/backfill-results` (reads final HT/FT scores from league-matches and writes
only the result fields — snap/signals/rank untouched). Check `/supabase-status.selfCapture`
for the last timer run.

## Conventions and Patterns

- **No TypeScript, no ESLint, no Prettier** — plain JavaScript with no enforced style
- **HTML is built via string concatenation** in `buildHTML()` — no template engine
- **Section comments** use `// ─── SECTION ─────` divider format
- **Fix comments** labeled `FIX 1` through `FIX 4` document known workarounds
- **Previous-season fallback**: `PREV_SEASON` map provides fallback season IDs
  when current season has < 5 completed matches
- **Backfill is safe**: both `/admin/backfill` and `/admin/load-dataset` use
  `ignoreDuplicates: true` — running them will never overwrite a live-captured snap.
  `/admin/backfill-results` only UPDATEs result fields (`ht_*`/`ft_*`/`fh_total`/`hit_*`)
  on rows where `hit_25 IS NULL`, so it never touches a frozen snap/signals/rank either.

## Dataset

A CSV dataset (`dataset_combined_filled.csv`) was built and maintained separately
for backtesting. **Do not use it for signal calibration** — the season stats are
end-of-season figures (look-ahead bias). It is a research artifact only.

## Planned: Self-Learning System

The goal is to make the server recalibrate probability tables and signal weights
from its own completed match history, without requiring manual dataset updates.

### Phase 1 — Rolling probability recalibration (in-memory)
- On each `/preds` call, scan `SERVER_MATCH_CACHE` for completed matches
- Recompute `PROB25_BY_COMBO` and `PROB15_BY_COMBO` from recent results
- Apply a minimum sample guardrail (n ≥ 30 per rank) before overriding defaults
- Resets on Render restart — useful for session-level adaptation

### Phase 2 — League-specific probability tables (persisted)
- Maintain separate prob tables per league/competition_id
- Persist to Supabase (`league_prob_tables`)
- Update nightly from accumulated match results

### Phase 3 — Weighted signal scoring per league
- Replace integer rank count with a weighted float score
- Weights learned per league from match history
- Matches ranked by score rather than signal count
- Requires Phase 2 persistence infrastructure

**Constraint:** Render free tier has no disk persistence between restarts.
All learning that needs to survive restarts must use Supabase.

## Environment

- **No Docker** — deployed directly as a Node.js app on Render
- **Supabase** — `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` required for persistence
- **GitHub Actions** — single workflow for keep-alive pings to prevent Render free-tier spin-down
- **Auto-deploy** — Render deploys automatically on push to main branch
- **`LOAD_DATASET_TOKEN`** — optional; gates admin endpoints. Fails closed (503) if not set.

## Important Notes for AI Assistants

- All logic is in `server.js` — there are no other source files
- The frontend is fully inline (HTML/CSS/JS inside `buildHTML()`) — changes
  to UI require editing string literals in server.js
- `node-fetch` v2 is used (CommonJS `require()` compatible) — do not upgrade
  to v3 without converting to ESM
- The `FOOTY_API_KEY` is sensitive — never commit it or log it in full
- The app handles rate limiting gracefully by serving cached data — preserve
  this behavior in all modifications
- `PREV_SEASON` mappings need manual updates when new seasons start
- **Signals A and B use last-5 FH form** read from `snap.l5`; **Signal C uses season
  stats** (`scored_fh`/`conced_fh`) from `snap.home`/`snap.away`. When `snap.l5` is absent,
  A and B can't fire but **C still can** (it reads season stats), so rank may be 1 (combo
  `001`) on thin leagues. `computeSignals(snap, hLast5, aLast5)` reads both directly.
- **`snap.l5` is self-reconstructed only** (from `LEAGUE_MATCHES_CACHE`). There is **no
  native FootyStats last-5 HT stat** to fall back on — `scoredAVGHT_*_5` fields do not
  exist in the team-stats API (verified via `/debug-raw-api` verdict). When the cache is
  thin (USL2/WPSL short seasons) `l5` is null and the signals cannot fire.
- **`snap.prematch`** captures FootyStats' own pre-match FH predictors (`o15HT`, `o05HT`,
  `xgHome`, `xgAway`, `btts_fhg`) at freeze time — the ONLY pre-game FH signal available
  for thin leagues. Not yet a live signal; being calibrated via `/prematch-mine` as a
  fallback for when `l5` is null. Backfill historical rows with `/admin/backfill-prematch`
  (additive — merges only a `prematch` sub-object into snap, never touches l5/home/away).
- **Signal letters are reused across generations.** The current production Signal C is
  **Team Mismatch** (season net-FH *rating gap* ≥ 0.5). Do NOT confuse it with the *dropped*
  old "Signal C — Both Scoring" (`hF>0.8 & aF>0.8`, below-baseline — see Deprecated) or with
  the dropped season-stat **Signal E** (Home Profile, `t1_pct`/`scored_fh` *levels*). Today's
  C is a *difference* between the two teams, validated as a rank-0 rescue (`/signalc-validate`,
  `/mismatch-holdout`) — it is a different construct from the level-based E.
- **Do NOT reintroduce the old level-based Signal E** (`t1_pct`/`scored_fh` levels), the old
  "Both Scoring"/"Both Open"/"Attack vs Leak" signals, or Signal D — all dropped on clean data
  for thin samples / below-baseline lift. See "Deprecated / removed signals".
- **Do not add odds-based signals** — odds data is not reliably available pre-kickoff
- **Do not reintroduce CN010 as a core signal** — near-zero additive value on clean data
- **Women's leagues (15020, 16037, 16046, 16563) must be excluded** from any
  threshold recalibration or model retraining
- **Match ordering is probability-first**: `prob25 → prob15 → ci → rank` (in `computePreds`
  and the client day / best-bets sorts). The per-combo calibrated probability is the source
  of truth — because Signal C is anti-additive, rank count can disagree (a rank-2 `011` can
  sort below a rank-1 `010`). `ci`/`rank` are only tiebreakers now, not the primary key.
- `computeSignals()` returns `ci` (combined intensity = `homeL5Total + awayL5Total`) and
  `defCi` (away last-5 FH total) — keep them in the return object, they feed display and the
  sort tiebreak
- The `eligible` flag (**rank ≥ 2**) controls star badges on league pills in the UI.
  `applyLeagueProb()` no longer overrides it with a `prob25 >= 40` rule (that was always
  false on the global table, max ~20% — it silently killed the badge). `eligible25` /
  `eligible15` remain as informational prob-tier flags only; nothing gates on them
  (`betPill` is signal-based).
- The 🔥/🎯 badges (`betPill`) are **signal-based** (🔥 = A+B both fire, 🎯 = B fires),
  not prob-based. **Signal C deliberately fires no betPill** — it reshapes the combo
  probability and ranking only, so wiring C never minted new 🔥/🎯 bets.
- `snap.l5` carries the last-5 inputs signals A and B use — preserve it in the snapshot path;
  `snap.home`/`snap.away` `scored_fh`/`conced_fh` carry the inputs Signal C uses.
- **combo string is 3 chars** (`bit(A) + bit(B) + bit(C)`) — do not revert to 2-char.
  `comboFromSignals()` and `applyLeagueProb()` use it (the Supabase combo RPC still emits
  2-char and falls back gracefully — see "combo string format").
- **To realign stored rows with the current model**, use `/admin/recompute-signals`
  (runs the real `computeSignals()`). The old `/admin/backfill-signal-d` route was
  removed — it wrote a phantom Signal C and a 3-signal rank.
- **Backfill guard**: both admin upsert routes use `ignoreDuplicates: true` — do not remove this
